# FIFA-21-Player-Analysis
The aim of this project is to perform Data Wrangling, Cleaning and Player Analysis of the FIFA 21 data from Kaggle.

## Technologies used:
* Python / Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## What's been completed?
This is a WIP notebook.
I've performed Exploratory Data Analysis and have completed Data Cleansing using Pandas.

## What next to complete?
* Produce visualizations using libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib
* Produce insights of the Player data

## What I'm thinking of also potentially doing:
* Create dashboard from the master data file produced from data cleansing in Tableau, or
* Produce an interactive dashboard web app [using the Streamlit framework](https://streamlit.io/)

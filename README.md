# FIFA-21-Player-Analysis
The aim of this project is to perform Data Wrangling, Cleaning and Player Analysis of the FIFA 21 data from Kaggle.

We will be exploring the wages of the different players and ascertain the relationships between the variables that results in Salary differences for the players. Variables such as the following will be explored to uncover insights:
* Player Country
* Player Club
* Age (we'll investigate if the age really makes a difference to the wages)
* The existing monetary value of the player
* Skill variables such as: Attacking, Defending, Goalkeeping etc.
* Player Potential

We will also do an analysis of the Players with similar abilities and contrast their salaries and skills.

## Technologies used:
* Python / Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

## What's been completed?
This is a WIP notebook.
I've performed Exploratory Data Analysis and have completed Data Cleansing using Pandas.

## What next to complete?
* Produce visualizations using libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib
* Produce insights of the Player data

## What I'm thinking of also potentially doing:
* Create dashboard from the master data file produced from data cleansing in Tableau, or
* Produce an interactive dashboard web app [using the Streamlit framework](https://streamlit.io/)
